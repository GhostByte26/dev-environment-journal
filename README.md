\# Embedded Systems \& OS Engineering Roadmap

\### Author: Gilberto Medina



---



\## Overview

This repository documents my long-term roadmap toward mastering C++, embedded systems, and operating system development.  

The focus is on depth, discipline, and technical precision—building the skills required to design software that interacts directly with hardware and system resources.



This roadmap serves both as a professional development record and as an accountability framework guiding all projects in this repository.

\## Roadmap Summary



| Phase | Title | Core Objective |

|-------|--------|----------------|

| 1 | Core Fundamentals | Build strong C++ foundations and problem-solving habits through simulation projects. |

| 2 | Hardware Integration | Learn microcontroller-level programming using Arduino and ESP32. |

| 3 | Connectivity \& RTOS | Implement multitasking, APIs, and Wi-Fi using FreeRTOS and embedded networking. |

| 4 | OS Foundations | Develop a small operating system kernel and understand process management. |

| 5 | Capstone Project | Combine all phases into a functional embedded badge running a custom mini-OS. |

\## Phase 1 – Core Fundamentals (Current Stage)



\*\*Goal:\*\*  

Establish full command over C++ logic, data structures, and debugging through practical desktop projects that simulate embedded environments.



\*\*Weekly Project Progression:\*\*



| Week | Focus | Project |

|------|--------|----------|

| 1 | Variables, I/O, loops, conditionals | Math Toolkit |

| 2 | Arrays, functions | Array Analyzer |

| 3 | Strings, validation | Word Analyzer |

| 4 | File I/O, structs | Temperature Logger |

| 5 | Modularization | Scientific Calculator v2 |

| 6 | Vectors, dynamic memory | Grades Tracker | 7 | Classes, OOP intro | Bank Account Manager |

| 8 | Pointers, references | Memory Visualizer |

| 9–10 | Integration | Mini RTOS Simulation |



\*\*Work Pattern (Sunday–Thursday):\*\*  

\- Sunday – Review previous work, plan new project  

\- Monday – Study and prototype new concept  

\- Tuesday – Continue implementation and testing  

\- Wednesday – Document progress  

\- Thursday – Finalize and push to GitHub

\## Future Phases



\### Phase 2 – Hardware Integration

\- \*\*Objective:\*\* Apply C++ fundamentals to physical hardware.  

\- \*\*Focus Areas:\*\* GPIO control, interrupts, sensors, display output.  

\- \*\*Example Projects:\*\* LED controller, sensor logger, serial interface visualizer.  



\### Phase 3 – Connectivity \& RTOS

\- \*\*Objective:\*\* Introduce multitasking and networking on embedded boards.  

\- \*\*Focus Areas:\*\* Task scheduling, synchronization, Wi-Fi APIs, JSON parsing.  

\- \*\*Example Projects:\*\* GitHub API OLED display, embedded game (Flappy Bird).  



\### Phase 4 – OS Foundations

\- \*\*Objective:\*\* Understand kernel internals and OS boot sequence.  

\- \*\*Focus Areas:\*\* Bootloader development, interrupt handling, memory management.  

\- \*\*Example Projects:\*\* Bare-metal bootloader, minimal kernel, custom shell.  



\### Phase 5 – Capstone Project

\- \*\*Objective:\*\* Integrate all previous knowledge into a single hardware system.  

\- \*\*Deliverable:\*\* “OpenBadge OS” – a functional badge featuring:  

&nbsp; - System boot logo and menu  

&nbsp; - GitHub profile integration  

&nbsp; - Built-in mini-game  

&nbsp; - Custom task scheduler

\## Mentorship Contract



I commit to a disciplined, incremental approach to engineering growth.  

Each phase will be completed in full before advancing. I will prioritize understanding over speed and consistency over intensity.  



I will hold myself accountable by documenting all progress inside `/project-ideas.md` and by maintaining a professional engineering standard across every project in this repository.  



This roadmap reflects my long-term goal: to become a capable systems and embedded software engineer who builds reliable, efficient, and purposeful technology.

\## Toolchain \& Environment



\- \*\*Operating System:\*\* Windows 10 / PowerShell 7  

\- \*\*Development Environment:\*\* VS Code + CLion  

\- \*\*Compiler:\*\* MinGW (GCC)  

\- \*\*Hardware (later phases):\*\* Arduino Uno, ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico  

\- \*\*RTOS:\*\* FreeRTOS  

\- \*\*Additional Tools:\*\* PlatformIO, CMake, Git, QEMU (for OS simulation)

\## Progress Tracking



Weekly logs, notes, and new project ideas are documented in  

`/project-ideas.md`.



Each entry should include:

1\. Project name  

2\. Problem statement  

3\. Concepts reinforced  

4\. Lessons learned  

5\. Next steps or improvements  



This ensures continuous iteration and technical clarity across the learning process.
