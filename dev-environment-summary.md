# 🛠️ Developer Environment Summary

A complete reference of my developer setup, tools, reasons behind each step, and practical uses — designed to reinforce consistency and accelerate growth.

---

## 💻 Operating System
- **Windows 10/11**
- Reason: Familiar ecosystem, broad tool support

---

## 🧵 Terminal Setup

### PowerShell 7
- ✅ Installed latest version
- ✅ Set as default terminal in VS Code
- ✅ Autocomplete via PSReadLine
- ✅ Custom `$PROFILE` saved and pushed

**Why**: Modern scripting, cross-platform support, tab completion, easier command experience than Windows PowerShell

### Oh My Posh
- ✅ Installed and set theme path
- ✅ Will add custom prompt later

**Why**: Visual feedback on Git status, active Python/C++ environments, prompt memory cues

---

## 🧰 Toolchain

### MinGW-w64
- ✅ Installed and added to PATH
- ✅ Confirmed `g++` version working (15.2.0)
- ✅ Compiled and ran programs successfully

**Why**: Minimal, fast C++ toolchain that works great with VS Code  
Used to compile `main.cpp`, `calculator`, etc.

---

## 🧠 VS Code

- ✅ C++ Build Task configured (`Ctrl + Shift + B`)
- ✅ Integrated terminal set to PowerShell 7
- ✅ Syntax highlighting for `.cpp` and `.ps1`
- ✅ Workspace created: `C:\Projects\Cpp`

**Why**: Lightweight, flexible IDE with built-in Git, extensions, terminal, and debugger

---

## 📦 Git + GitHub

- ✅ Git installed and configured with GhostByte26
- ✅ All projects and logs pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Markdown-based logs version-controlled

### Repositories
- [x] `cpp-calculator`
- [x] `cpp-Number-Stats-Program`
- [x] `dev-environment-journal`

## 🧭 Why This Setup Matters

- ⏱️ **Faster coding**: Everything runs from terminal with one shortcut
- 📈 **Growth-focused**: Built for daily repetition and project iteration
- 🧠 **Memory reinforcement**: Git + markdown + terminal use = long-term retention
- 🧰 **Real-world habits**: Mirrors what software engineers do at work
