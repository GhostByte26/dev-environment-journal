|------------|---------------|------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------|-------|
| 2025.11.04 | Two Sum       | Easy       | C++       | Hash Map  | 30 min      | ✅ Solved  | Resolved using brute force linear search |
| 2025.11.10 | Two Sum       | Easy       | C++       | Hash Map  | 45 min      | ✅ Solved  | Resolved using unordered_map for O(n) lookup search |
| 2025.11.18 | Palindrome Number | Easy | C++ | Math, Two-Pointer (conceptually), Integer Manipulation | ~2 hours | ✅ Solved | Learned digit extraction (%) and digit removal (/10), reversal pattern, and overflow handling with long long |
| 2025-11-24 | Merge Strings Alternately (1768) | Easy | C++ | Strings, Two-Pointer Logic | 20 min | ✅ Solved | Brute-force/straightforward merge using shared index `i` (O(n + m)) |
2025-11-26 | 1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings | Easy | C++ | Strings, Math (GCD), Pattern Matching | ~1.5 hours total | ✅ Solved| Learned that the key is checking if str1+str2 == str2+str1 to confirm a shared pattern. GCD applies to lengths, not strings. Return prefix using substr(0, gcd). No loops needed.                                                                                 |-|
| 2025-12-03 | Can Place Flowers (605)       | Easy       | C++      | Arrays, Simulation, Boundary Checks    | 45 min     | ✅ Solved   | Brute-force simulation with neighbor checks; practiced safe boundaries and mutation. |
