## Legend
- **Week:** Approximate order of completion, not strict calendar weeks.  
- **Status:**  
  - ☐ = Planned / In Progress  
  - ☑ = Completed / Pushed to GitHub  
  - ⚙️ = Under Revision / Refactoring

## Usage Notes
- Update this table at the end of each development week.  
- Keep lesson summaries brief (1–2 lines).  
- Completed projects should be committed to GitHub with detailed `README` files inside their respective folders.  
- Each completed row should have a commit message referencing the project name.
